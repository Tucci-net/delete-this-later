<p> I am a versatile emerging designer who delves into game design, cyber security, and tech communication. Along with such, 
    I engage in various game jams and indie development, while also being a punk rock musician. Beyond school, I enjoy gaming,
    punk music, art, and spending time with my girlfriend. I am passionate and dedicated, fully committing to projects, from
    designing posters to building neural networks. Proficient in programming and Adobe Creative Suite, I aim to work for
    major game studios, aspiring to create my own game. My career blends artistry, tech prowess, and a drive for innovation.</p>
